Welcome to browsepy's documentation!
====================================

Welcome to Flaskâ€™s documentation. Starting with installation and Quickstart is
recommended. More detailed Tutorial about integrating :module:`browsepy` as
module or plugin development are also available.

Browsepy has few dependencies: Flasn and scandir. Flask is an awesome web microframework and scandir is a directory listing library which `is included
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/>`_ in Python's standard library
starting from Python 3.5, if you want to dive into their documentation, check
