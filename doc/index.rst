Welcome to browsepy's documentation!
====================================

Welcome to browsepy's documentation. It's recommended to start reading
installation and Quickstart. More detailed tutorials about integrating :mod:`browsepy` as module or plugin development are available too.

Browsepy has few dependencies: `Flask`_ and `Scandir`_. `Flask`_ is an awesome
web microframework while `Scandir`_ is a directory listing library which `was
included <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/>`_ in Python 3.5's
standard library.
